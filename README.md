# Noor Class WordPress Theme

This theme was converted from a static website. To enable the newsletter form displayed with `[newsletter_form]` you need to install the free **Newsletter** plugin by Stefano Lissa & The Newsletter Team.

1. From your WordPress admin dashboard go to **Plugins → Add New**.
2. Search for "Newsletter" and install the plugin authored by *Stefano Lissa & The Newsletter Team*.
3. Activate it and configure your forms under **Newsletter → Forms**.
4. The shortcode `[newsletter_form]` used in the theme templates will then render the subscription form.

The theme also registers a sidebar ("Primary Sidebar") that appears on archive and single post pages. Add widgets to it under **Appearance → Widgets**.
